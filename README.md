# Keeb-Alert
A python application to send alerts for new interest checks (IC) and group buys (GB) for mechanical keyboards on the Geek Hack forum.

The application is capable of sending SMS and Email alerts, as well as console output. Sending SMS is handled through Twilio. Email
requires setting up an email account for the program to send from. 

## Useage
Run `git clone https://github.com/Seopril/Keeb-Alert.git` to download the source code.

## TODO
- Update README with all of the command line arguments. 
- Update README to explain all functionality including IC and GB baselines
